History of Present Illness: The patient was found unresponsive at home by family members. On arrival, he was noted to be disoriented, hypotensive (BP 90/50 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 110 bpm), and febrile (T 38.2°C). Physical exam revealed dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and decreased peripheral perfusion, consistent with severe dehydration. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly elevated blood glucose (BG >600 mg/dL), hyperosmolarity (effective serum osmolality >320 mOsm/kg), and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient was prescribed insulin isophane, human 70 UNT/ML / insulin, regular, human 30 UNT/ML Injectable Suspension , lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet prior to this admission, but it appears he was nonadherent or experienced a medication error leading to this acute decompensation. Medication Reconciliation: - Insulin isophane, human 70 UNT/ML / insulin, regular, human 30 UNT/ML Injectable Suspension : 30 units subcutaneously daily. Instruction: Mix the suspension by gently rolling the vial between the palms for 10 seconds before drawing up the dose. Inject subcutaneously into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, rotating injection sites to prevent lipodystrophy. Take at the same time each day, typically in the morning with breakfast. - Lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet: 10 mg orally daily. Instruction: Take once daily, preferably in the morning, with or without food. Avoid abrupt discontinuation. Report any signs of angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue) or hypotension (dizziness, fainting). Assessments Performed: - Medication reconciliation - Assessment of health and social care needs - Assessment of anxiety - Depression screening - Depression screening (repeat) - Assessment of substance use - Screening for drug abuse - Patient referral for dental care procedure(s) Plan: 1. IV Fluid Resuscitation: Initiate with 0.9% normal saline at 250 mL/hour to correct dehydration and hyperglycemia. 2. Insulin Therapy: Administer IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hr with frequent glucose monitoring. 3. Correction of Electrolytes: Check serum potassium and magnesium; replace as needed. 4. Lisinopril: Hold temporarily due to hypotension; resume once BP stabilizes. 5. Further Evaluation: Admit to the hospital for HHS management, diabetes education, and adherence counseling. 6.

Medical Note Patient Information: - Name: Wisoky380, Abe604 Elisha578
- Age: 67 years
- Gender: Male
- Race: White Reason for Encounter: General examination of the patient for routine health assessment and medication reconciliation. History of Present Illness: The patient is a 67-year-old male presenting for a general examination. He has been prescribed the following medications:
1. Insulin isophane, human 70 UNT/ML / insulin, regular, human 30 UNT/ML Injectable Suspension 2. Lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet The patient underwent a medication reconciliation procedure to ensure all current medications are accounted for and appropriate. Symptoms: Given the patient's medications, potential symptoms to monitor include:
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) due to insulin therapy, which may present as sweating, tremors, confusion, dizziness, or palpitations.
- Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) if insulin dosage is insufficient, which may present as increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, or blurred vision.
- Hypertension-related symptoms if lisinopril is not effectively managing blood pressure, such as headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
- Dizziness or cough, which can be side effects of lisinopril. Medication Instructions: 1. Insulin isophane, human 70 UNT/ML / insulin, regular, human 30 UNT/ML Injectable Suspension : - This is a combination insulin product that includes both intermediate-acting (NPH) and short-acting (regular) insulin. - The patient should inject this subcutaneously as prescribed by their healthcare provider. - The injection should be administered at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood glucose levels. - The patient should rotate injection sites to prevent lipodystrophy (thickening or thinning of the skin). - Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and adjust insulin dosage as directed by the healthcare provider. - Be aware of the signs of hypoglycemia and have a fast-acting carbohydrate source available (e.g., glucose tablets, juice) in case of low blood sugar. - Avoid alcohol consumption, as it can affect blood sugar levels and increase the risk of hypoglycemia. 2. Lisinopril 10 MG Oral Tablet: - This medication is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure. - The patient should take one tablet orally once daily, preferably at the same time each day. - Lisinopril can cause dizziness, especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose. The patient should rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to minimize this risk. - The patient should report any persistent cough, swelling of the face or throat, or difficulty breathing, as these could be signs of a serious side effect. - Maintain adequate hydration and monitor for signs of dehydration, especially if experiencing diarrhea or vomiting. Plan: - Continue with the prescribed medications and follow the instructions provided.
- Schedule follow-up appointments as recommended by the healthcare provider to monitor blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and overall health.
- Educate the patient on the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, to manage diabetes and hypertension effectively. Signature: Medical Scribe

Medical Note Patient Information: - Name: Wisoky380, Abe604 Elisha578
- Age: 68
- Gender: Male
- Race: White Chief Complaint: Viral sinusitis symptoms. History of Present Illness: The patient presents today with symptoms consistent with viral sinusitis. He reports the onset of symptoms approximately one week ago, beginning with nasal congestion and facial pressure. Over the past few days, he has experienced worsening symptoms, including:
- Facial pain, particularly in the maxillary and frontal sinus regions.
- Thick, discolored nasal discharge (yellow or green).
- Postnasal drip.
- Headache, often localized to the forehead or cheeks.
- Fatigue and malaise.
- Mild to moderate fever (reported temperature of 100.4°F at home this morning).
- Cough, which is worse at night.
- Occasional sore throat due to postnasal drip. The patient denies any recent history of trauma or environmental exposures that could explain these symptoms. He reports no improvement with over-the-counter decongestants or saline nasal sprays. He has no known allergies to medications. Review of Systems: - Constitutional: Reports fatigue and malaise.
- HEENT: Nasal congestion, facial pain, thick nasal discharge, sore throat.
- Respiratory: Cough, no shortness of breath or wheezing.
- Cardiovascular: No chest pain or palpitations.
- Gastrointestinal: No nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
- Musculoskeletal: No joint pain or muscle aches.
- Neurological: No headache other than sinus-related pain.
- Skin: No rash or itching. Physical Examination: - Vital Signs: Temperature 100.4°F, BP 130/80, HR 82, RR 16, O2 Sat 98% on room air.
- HEENT: Mild erythema of the nasal mucosa, clear to purulent nasal discharge upon anterior rhinoscopy. Tenderness noted over the maxillary and frontal sinuses upon palpation. Mild pharyngeal erythema without exudates.
- Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
- Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles.
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
- Extremities: No edema. Assessment: 1. Viral sinusitis: The patient’s symptoms, including facial pain, nasal congestion, purulent discharge, and fever, are consistent with viral sinusitis. The absence of focal bacterial infection signs (e.g., high fever, severe localized pain, or systemic toxicity) suggests a viral etiology.
2. Rule out bacterial sinusitis: While less likely given the clinical presentation, bacterial sinusitis cannot be entirely excluded at this time. Close follow-up is recommended. Plan: 1. Symptomatic management: - Encourage hydration and rest. - Over-the-counter analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for pain and fever. - Saline nasal irrigation (e.g., neti pot or saline spray) to help clear nasal passages. - Short course of oral decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine) if tolerated, with caution due to age and potential side effects.
2. Monitor for signs of worsening or complications (e.g., high fever, worsening facial pain, or purulent discharge persisting beyond 7-10 days), which may indicate a need for further evaluation or antibiotics.
3. Return instructions: Instruct patient to return if symptoms do not improve within 7-10 days or if they worsen significantly.
4. Follow-up: Consider follow-up in 1-2 weeks if symptoms persist or if there is concern for secondary bacterial infection. Signature: , Medical Scribe

Medical Note Patient Information:
- Name: Wisoky380, Abe604 Elisha578
- Age: 71 years
- Gender: Male
- Race: White Reason for Encounter:
The patient is a 71-year-old white male presenting for a medical encounter related to renal dialysis and anemia management. History of Present Illness:
The patient is currently undergoing renal dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). During this encounter, it was noted that the patient has anemia, which is a common complication of renal failure. The patient was prescribed Epoetin Alfa 4000 UNT/ML Injection to manage his anemia. Symptoms:
The patient may experience symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, and pale skin. These symptoms are often caused by a deficiency in red blood cells, which can occur as a result of reduced erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure. Renal Dialysis:
The patient underwent renal dialysis procedure(s) during this encounter. Dialysis is a treatment that helps remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys are no longer able to perform these functions effectively. Medication Prescription:
The patient was prescribed 1 ML Epoetin Alfa 4000 UNT/ML Injection . This medication is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. It is administered to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Instructions for Taking Epoetin Alfa:
- The prescribed dose is 1 mL of Epoetin Alfa 4000 UNT/ML Injection .
- The medication should be administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as directed by the healthcare provider.
- The injection can be self-administered by the patient or administered by a caregiver, as instructed by the healthcare provider.
- It is important to rotate the injection site to prevent skin irritation or other complications.
- The medication should be taken at the same time each day or as prescribed by the healthcare provider.
- The patient should not adjust the dose or stop taking the medication without consulting the healthcare provider.
- The patient should report any side effects or concerns to the healthcare provider. Follow-up:
The patient should schedule a follow-up appointment with the healthcare provider to monitor the effectiveness of the medication and assess any changes in symptoms. Regular monitoring of hematocrit and hemoglobin levels will be necessary to ensure optimal anemia management. Conclusion:
The patient is currently undergoing renal dialysis and has been prescribed Epoetin Alfa 4000 UNT/ML Injection for the management of anemia. It is important for the patient to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and follow-up with the healthcare provider for ongoing monitoring and management of his condition.

He presents today for ongoing management. The patient reports symptoms consistent with advanced CKD, including: - Fatigue and generalized weakness (likely due to anemia secondary to decreased erythropoietin production). - Shortness of breath on exertion, possibly related to fluid overload or anemia. - Nausea and poor appetite (may indicate uremia or metabolic disturbances). - Swelling in the lower extremities (edema) due to fluid retention. - Itching (pruritus), a common symptom of advanced CKD. - Decreased urine output (oliguria), consistent with reduced renal function. The patient has been undergoing renal dialysis procedures as part of his management plan. Medication Management: The patient was prescribed 1 mL Epoetin Alfa 4000 UNT/ML Injection to address anemia associated with CKD. Instructions for Epoetin Alfa (Epogen) Administration: 1. Dosage: Administer 1 mL (4000 units) subcutaneously once weekly. 2. Preparation: - Ensure the vial of Epogen is at room temperature. - Clean the injection site (e.g., abdomen, thigh, or upper arm) with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry. 3. Injection Technique: - Pinch a fold of skin and inject the medication subcutaneously at a 45° or 90° angle. - Do not massage the site after injection. 4. Monitoring: - Monitor for signs of hypertension (e.g., headaches, blurred vision) as Epogen can increase blood pressure. - Watch for allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling). - Report any unusual bleeding or bruising , as Epogen may affect clotting factors. 5. Follow-Up: - Return for routine blood work (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit) to assess response to therapy. - Continue scheduled dialysis appointments as directed. Plan: - Continue dialysis as per nephrologist’s recommendations. - Monitor for symptom improvement (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath) and adverse effects of Epogen. - Follow up in 4 weeks for reevaluation and blood work.
