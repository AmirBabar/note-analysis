SUBJECTIVE History of Present Illness (HPI): Adah is a 2-year-old white female who presents to the clinic for evaluation of persistent upper respiratory symptoms. Her mother reports that the illness began approximately 11 days ago with a clear runny nose and mild cough. Over the past 4-5 days, her mother states her symptoms have worsened. The nasal discharge has changed from clear to thick, purulent, and consistently yellow. The cough has become more frequent and is described as a "deep, wet cough," worse at night and upon waking in the morning, often causing her to gag. She has had a fever for the last 3 days, with a maximum temperature of 102.3°F (39.1°C) at home, which has responded temporarily to acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Mother notes the patient has been more irritable and fussy than usual, has a decreased appetite, and has had some disrupted sleep. Mother also reports noticing some bad breath. She denies any episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or ear pain. Medications: Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen, given as needed for fever/pain. No other recent medications. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies (NKDA). Past Medical History (PMH): Full-term birth, uncomplicated. Immunizations are up to date. No known chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE Vitals: Temp: 101.9°F (38.8°C) HR: 115 bpm RR: 24/min BP: 92/58 mmHg SpO2: 99% on room air Weight: 28.2 lbs (12.8 kg) Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented, and interactive but appears acutely ill and mildly irritable. Well-nourished, well-developed. HEENT: Head: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: PERRLA. Conjunctivae clear without injection. No periorbital edema. Ears: TMs gray, normal light reflex, good mobility. No erythema or effusion. Nose: Nasal mucosa is erythematous and edematous. Thick, purulent, yellow secretions are visualized in both nasal passages. Throat: Oropharynx mildly erythematous without exudates. Tonsils 1+, non-erythematous. No intraoral lesions. Foul breath noted. Neck: Supple, full range of motion. Shotty anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Lungs: Cough noted throughout exam. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good air entry. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds active in all four quadrants. ASSESSMENT & PLAN Assessment: 1. Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: Characterized by >10 days of symptoms without improvement, purulent nasal discharge, and secondary worsening with fever and cough. Exam findings of purulent discharge support this diagnosis.
2. Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI): As the initial inciting event, but has now progressed to a secondary bacterial infection. Plan: 1. Antibiotic Therapy: Will start a course of Amoxicillin-clavulanate to treat the likely bacterial pathogens. Rx: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 400mg/57mg, 5.5 mL by mouth twice daily for 10 days. 2. Supportive Care: Continue antipyretics (Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen) for fever/discomfort as needed. Encourage increased fluid intake. Recommend saline nasal spray/drops before meals and bedtime to help clear nasal passages.
3. Patient Education: Discussed with mother the nature of bacterial sinusitis, the importance of completing the full 10-day course of antibiotics, and what to expect regarding the timeline for improvement (typically 48-72 hours). Provided return precautions: Instructed mother to return to the clinic or seek emergency care if Adah develops a high fever (>104°F), increasing irritability/lethargy, any swelling or redness around the eyes, difficulty breathing, or if symptoms do not improve after 72 hours of antibiotic therapy.
4. Follow-up: Follow-up via telephone call in 2-3 days to assess response to treatment, otherwise as needed. , MD

Of course. Here is a prenatal visit medical note for the patient you described, written in a standard SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format. PRENATAL OFFICE NOTE DATE OF SERVICE: PATIENT: Ward, Adah626 Jenni670 MRN: 668 DOB: AGE: 19 SEX: F RACE: White CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC): Routine prenatal visit for pregnancy complicated by congenital uterine anomaly. SUBJECTIVE (S): The patient is a G2 P0010, 19-year-old white female, here for a routine prenatal check-up at an estimated 20 weeks 0 days gestation. Her pregnancy has been complicated by a known congenital uterine anomaly, specifically a bicornuate uterus, diagnosed via a prior pelvic MRI. History of Present Illness (HPI): Patient reports feeling well overall. She states she has been consistent with taking her prenatal vitamins. She has felt fetal movements for the past two weeks, which she describes as "flutters" that are becoming more frequent. She reports occasional, mild, intermittent lower abdominal cramping, which is non-radiating and not associated with any activity. She denies any vaginal bleeding, spotting, or fluid leakage. She denies any regular or painful contractions. She has had some mild nausea but no vomiting. Patient expresses significant anxiety regarding her uterine anomaly and its potential impact on the pregnancy, specifically mentioning her fear of miscarriage and preterm delivery. She had a previous first-trimester miscarriage. Review of Systems (ROS): Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills, or recent weight changes. HEENT: No headaches, vision changes, or nasal congestion. Cardiovascular: No chest pain or palpitations. Respiratory: No shortness of breath or cough. Gastrointestinal: Occasional mild nausea. Denies diarrhea or constipation. Genitourinary: Denies dysuria, urgency, or frequency beyond that expected in pregnancy. No hematuria. Musculoskeletal: No back pain. Neurological: No dizziness or syncope. OBJECTIVE (O): Vitals: BP: 108/68 mmHg HR: 80 bpm RR: 16 bpm Temp: 98.4°F (36.9°C) Weight: 152 lbs (Weight gain of 3 lbs since last visit) Physical Exam: General: Alert, oriented x4, well-appearing, in no acute distress. Abdomen: Gravid, non-tender, soft. Fundal height is 20 cm, which is appropriate for gestational age. Uterine contour is slightly irregular, consistent with known bicornuate uterus. Fetal heart tones (FHT) auscultated with Doppler in the right upper quadrant, rate 148 bpm, regular. Extremities: No edema noted. No calf tenderness. Labs/Imaging: Patient's anatomy scan from last week was reviewed. Report indicates fetal growth is appropriate for gestational age. Amniotic fluid index is normal. Placenta is posterior, away from the internal cervical os. Fetal position is currently breech. ASSESSMENT (A): 1. Gestation, G2 P0010 at 20w0d. 2. Bicornuate Uterus: A major uterine anomaly, increasing risk for: Miscarriage (as per patient history) Preterm labor and delivery Malpresentation (as seen on current ultrasound) Fetal growth restriction
3. Pregnancy-related anxiety. PLAN (P): 1. Continue routine prenatal care.
2. Counseling & Education: Extensive counseling provided to the patient regarding her specific risks associated with a bicornuate uterus. Reassured her that currently, the fetus is growing appropriately. Discussed signs and symptoms of preterm labor (regular contractions, pelvic pressure, low backache) and instructed her to call immediately or go to Labor & Delivery if these occur. Discussed the high likelihood of the baby changing position multiple times but also the increased chance of a non-vertex (breech or transverse) presentation at delivery, which may necessitate a Cesarean section.
3. Monitoring: Will begin serial ultrasounds for fetal growth in the third trimester (starting at ~28-30 weeks) to monitor for growth restriction. Will begin cervical length surveillance via transvaginal ultrasound at 24 weeks to assess for shortening, which would increase the risk of preterm birth.
4. Medications: Continue prenatal vitamins with DHA.
5. Follow-up: Return to the clinic in 4 weeks for routine prenatal visit. Instructed to call sooner for any bleeding, cramping, leakage of fluid, or decreased fetal movement.

She has not had any recent acute illnesses or surgeries. Medications: None. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies. OBJECTIVE Vitals: Temp: 98.6°F BP: 105/68 mmHg HR: 92 bpm RR: 16 breaths/min SpO2: 98% on room air Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented x4, appears tired. Mildly pale conjunctivae and nail beds noted. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Sclera anicteric. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or rales. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds normoactive in all four quadrants. ASSESSMENT & PLAN Assessment: 1. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Patient presents with classic symptoms of fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and dizziness. Physical exam is significant for pallor, consistent with anemia. Plan: 1. Ferrous Sulfate 325 MG Oral Tablet: Prescription: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg, 1 tablet by mouth once daily. Patient Education Provided: How to Take: For best absorption, take the iron tablet on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). If it causes significant stomach upset, you may take it with a small amount of food. Enhance Absorption: Take the tablet with a source of Vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice, to help your body absorb the iron more effectively. Avoid Interactions: Do not take iron at the same time as calcium supplements, antacids, or dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), as they can block absorption. Wait at least 2 hours between taking your iron and any of these items. Common Side Effects: Stool Changes: Your stools will likely become dark or black. This is a normal and harmless effect of the iron. Constipation: Iron can cause constipation. Increase your fluid intake, eat a high-fiber diet, and stay physically active. If constipation becomes a problem, you may use an over-the-counter stool softener. Stomach Upset: Nausea or stomach cramps can occur. Taking the supplement with food may help. Dietary Recommendations: Encouraged to increase intake of iron-rich foods, such as red meat, poultry, beans, lentils, spinach, and iron-fortified cereals. 2. Follow-up: Return to the clinic in 8-12 weeks for a follow-up appointment and to have blood work repeated to check your response to the treatment. The patient verbalized understanding of the plan and instructions. All questions were answered.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS (HPI): Ms. Ward is a 24-year-old white female who presents for follow-up management of chronic pain. She reports her pain, which has been present for several years, has been more severe over the past 2-3 months. The pain is described as a constant, deep, aching sensation primarily in her lower back and hips, but with intermittent sharp pains in her neck and shoulders. She rates her daily pain as a 6/10, with spikes to 8/10 on a bad day. The pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing, and physical activity, and is minimally relieved by over-the-counter ibuprofen and heat packs. Symptoms potentially associated with her chronic pain include: Sleep Disturbance: She reports significant difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep due to pain, averaging only 4-5 hours of non-restorative sleep per night. She often wakes up feeling tired. Fatigue: She endorses a profound and persistent daily fatigue, which she attributes to both the pain and poor sleep quality. She states she feels "drained" by the early afternoon. Mood Changes: The patient expresses feeling "frustrated" and "down" about her condition. She notes a significant loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed, such as hiking and going out with friends, due to pain and energy limitations. She denies suicidal ideation but admits to frequent irritability. Cognitive Difficulties: She describes "brain fog," having trouble with focus and memory at work, which she finds distressing. Headaches: She reports new onset of tension-type headaches over the last month, which she feels are related to neck pain and stress. She denies any recent trauma, fever, chills, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or numbness/tingling in her extremities. OBJECTIVE (O): Vitals: BP: 125/80 mmHg HR: 76 bpm RR: 16 /min Temp: 98.4°F SpO2: 99% on room air Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented x3. Appears tired. Moves with guarded, slow gait. Musculoskeletal: Tenderness to palpation over the lumbar paraspinal muscles, bilateral trapezius, and gluteal muscles. Limited range of motion in the lumbar spine with forward flexion and extension, reproducing her pain. No gross deformities or swelling noted. Strength 5/5 in all four extremities. Neurological: Sensation intact to light touch in all dermatomes. Deep tendon reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Coordination intact. ASSESSMENT & PLAN (A&P): Assessment: 1. Chronic Pain Syndrome, likely secondary to myofascial pain.
2. Chronic pain secondary insomnia.
3. Chronic pain related fatigue.
4. Chronic pain associated depression/anxiety. Plan: 1. Medications: We will start a trial of a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant, Amitriptyline 10mg at bedtime. This will help with pain modulation, improve sleep, and can assist with mood. Discussed side effects, primarily morning grogginess and dry mouth. Continue to use Acetaminophen as needed for breakthrough pain. Advised to limit NSAID (Ibuprofen/Naproxen) use due to potential for GI irritation.
2. Therapies & Referrals: Physical Therapy: A new referral for physical therapy will be placed to focus on core strengthening, postural training, and a graded exercise program. Behavioral Health: A referral to a psychologist specializing in chronic pain is strongly recommended to develop coping strategies, address the mood component, and learn techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for pain.
3. Patient Education: Discussed the multifactorial nature of chronic pain, emphasizing the link between pain, sleep, mood, and activity. Provided education on sleep hygiene techniques. Encouraged gentle, daily activity such as short walks, while avoiding overexertion on "good days."
4. Follow-up: Return to the clinic in 4 weeks to assess response to the new medication and referrals. We will contact her sooner if any issues arise. , MD

MEDICAL NOTE DATE OF SERVICE: PATIENT: Adah626 Jenni670 Ward668 DOB: AGE: 26 SEX: Female MRN: 626670668 CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC): Loss of teeth. SUBJECTIVE (S): The patient is a 26-year-old white female presenting for a dental consultation regarding missing teeth. She reports that she has been missing her lower left first molar for several years. She states that over the past 6-12 months, she has noticed increasing difficulty chewing on that side, frequent food impaction in the area, and feels that the adjacent teeth are "shifting." She is concerned about the long-term effects on her bite and oral health and is interested in exploring replacement options. She denies any current pain in the area. OBJECTIVE (O): VITALS: BP: 118/75 mmHg HR: 72 bpm RR: 16 bpm Temp: 98.4°F SpO2: 99% on room air PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Alert and oriented x4, in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic. Extraocular movements intact. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oral mucosa is pink and moist. Oral Cavity Examination: Dentition: Noted missing tooth #19 (lower left first molar). The surrounding gingival tissue appears healthy with no signs of active infection. Occlusion: Mild drifting of the adjacent teeth, tooth #18 (second premolar) and tooth #20 (second molar), is noted tipping towards the edentulous space. Opposing Arch: The opposing tooth, #14 (upper left first molar), shows slight supra-eruption into the space. Periodontal: No significant pocketing or bleeding on probing noted in the area. PROCEDURES/IMAGING PERFORMED: 1. Dental Consultation and Report: A comprehensive consultation was performed to evaluate the edentulous space and discuss treatment options.
2. Dental Plain X-ray, Bitewing: A bitewing radiograph of the lower left quadrant was taken and reviewed. The film confirms the absence of tooth #19. No interproximal caries are noted on the adjacent teeth. The bone level appears stable.
3. Take Oral or Dental Impression(s): Accurate alginate impressions of the maxillary and mandibular arches were taken and poured up in stone to create study models for treatment planning. ASSESSMENT (A): 1. Complete loss of teeth, unspecified, K08.1: Edentulism at site #19.
2. Posterior teeth irregularly positioned, K07.33: Drifting and tilting of adjacent teeth #18 and #20.
3. Vertical dimension of dentition lost, M26.53: Secondary to tooth loss and alveolar bone resorption. PLAN (P): 1. Discussion: The patient was educated on the consequences of the unreplaced missing tooth, including continued drifting of adjacent teeth, super-eruption of the opposing tooth, potential bone loss, and changes in occlusion. Treatment options were discussed in detail, including: Dental Implant: Pros and cons were reviewed, including its status as the gold standard for tooth replacement. Fixed Dental Bridge: Pros and cons were reviewed, including the need to prepare the adjacent healthy teeth. Removable Partial Denture: Pros and cons were reviewed, including its less-invasive nature but also less stability.
2. Next Steps: The study models created from today's impressions will be used to further analyze the space and plan for the chosen restorative option. The patient will schedule a follow-up appointment to finalize her treatment decision.
3. Patient Education: The patient was instructed to continue with good oral hygiene, including brushing twice daily and flossing, with special attention to the edentulous area to prevent food impaction and maintain gum health.
4. Follow-up: Return to the clinic in 2-4 weeks for definitive treatment planning. Scribe: Attending Physician:

MEDICAL RECORD PATIENT: Adah Ward MRN: 668-26-626 DATE OF ENCOUNTER: AGE: 26 SEX: Female ETHNICITY: White SUBJECTIVE Chief Complaint (CC): Follow-up for tooth loss and recent denture fitting. History of Present Illness (HPI): Ms. Ward is a 26-year-old female presenting for a follow-up appointment after being fitted for a removable partial denture to address tooth loss. The patient reports that prior to receiving the denture, she experienced significant difficulty chewing (masticatory dysfunction), which led her to avoid many foods, particularly harder items like apples and nuts. She also reported a decrease in self-confidence and was reluctant to smile in public due to the aesthetic appearance of her missing teeth. Additionally, she noted occasional minor slurring of words that she attributed to the gaps in her dentition. Since the initial fitting, Ms. Ward states the denture has markedly improved her ability to chew and her confidence in her smile. However, she reports that after wearing the denture for several hours, she experiences soreness on her lower left gum line. She describes the pain as a "raw, rubbing feeling" (7/10) that is relieved by removing the appliance. She is otherwise adapting well to speaking with the denture but feels it "clicks" occasionally. She denies any bleeding, swelling, or lesions in her mouth that she has noticed. She has been removing the denture at night and cleaning it daily as instructed. OBJECTIVE Vitals: BP: 118/76 mmHg HR: 72 bpm RR: 16 breaths/min Temp: 98.4°F (36.9°C) Physical Examination: General: Alert and oriented x4, in no acute distress. Oral Cavity: Dentures: Patient is wearing a mandibular removable partial denture. The appliance appears intact and clean. Minor lateral movement is noted on stability testing. Mucosa/Gingiva: The oral mucosa is moist and pink. On the left mandibular alveolar ridge, there is a small (approx. 5mm) area of erythema and slight edema corresponding to the flange of the partial denture. The area is tender to palpation. No ulcerations or fungating lesions are observed. Occlusion: Bite appears stable and even in centric occlusion. Remaining Dentition: All remaining teeth are present, free of caries, and show no signs of mobility. ASSESSMENT & PLAN Assessment: 1. Kennedy Class I Partial Edentulism (Mandibular): Status post partial denture fitting.
2. Denture-Induced Stomatitis: Localized irritation and inflammation of the left mandibular alveolar ridge mucosa due to pressure from the denture flange.
3. History of Masticatory Dysfunction and Aesthetic Concern secondary to tooth loss: Status: Improved. Plan: 1. Procedures: The left posterior flange of the mandibular partial denture will be adjusted and relieved to reduce pressure on the affected area.
2. Medications: No prescriptions are required at this time.
3. Patient Education: Reiterated instructions on proper denture hygiene, including brushing the denture and soaking it overnight. Advised the patient that initial soreness and increased salivation are common and typically resolve within a few weeks. Instructed her to wear the denture as much as possible to accelerate adaptation, but to remove it if soreness becomes severe.
4. Follow-up: Return to the clinic in 1-2 weeks for a follow-up evaluation of denture fit and tissue healing. Instructed to call sooner if the soreness worsens or if new issues arise. Scribed by:

Of course. Here is a medical note for the encounter, written in the standard SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format. PATIENT: Adah J. Ward DOB: DATE OF ENCOUNTER: PROVIDER: SUBJECTIVE Chief Complaint (CC): Sinus pressure and congestion for 5 days. History of Present Illness (HPI): Ms. Ward is a 27-year-old white female who presents for evaluation of progressive sinus symptoms. She reports that her symptoms began approximately 5 days ago with a mild sore throat, which has since resolved. Over the past 3-4 days, she has developed worsening bilateral nasal congestion, with thick, yellow-green nasal discharge. She describes significant pressure and pain across her cheeks and forehead, which she rates as 6/10 in severity. She notes the pain worsens significantly when she bends forward. Associated symptoms include fatigue, a low-grade fever with a maximum temperature of 100.8°F (measured at home), and a cough that is predominantly worse at night. She believes the cough is caused by post-nasal drip. She also reports a decreased sense of smell and taste. She has been using an over-the-counter oxymetazoline nasal spray, which provides temporary, minimal relief. She denies any vision changes, severe headache, neck stiffness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. She has not had any recent dental work. Past Medical History (PMH): No chronic medical conditions. Medications: Oxymetazoline nasal spray, 2-3 times per day for the past 3 days. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies (NKDA). OBJECTIVE Vitals: Temp: 100.6°F BP: 118/72 mmHg HR: 88 bpm RR: 16 breaths/min SpO2: 99% on room air General: Patient is alert and oriented x3, appearing mildly fatigued but in no acute distress. HEENT: Head: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: PERRLA. Conjunctivae clear, no scleral icterus. Extraocular movements intact. No periorbital edema. Ears: Tympanic membranes are normal in color and position, with good light reflex. No cerumen impaction. Nose: Nasal mucosa is erythematous and edematous. Thick, purulent, yellow-green discharge noted in bilateral middle meatus. Tenderness to palpation over the maxillary and frontal sinuses. Throat: Oropharynx is mildly erythematous without exudates. Post-nasal drip visualized. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. ASSESSMENT 1. Viral Sinusitis: The patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms less than 10 days in duration, including nasal congestion, purulent discharge, facial pressure/pain, and low-grade fever. The acute onset and presence of systemic symptoms (fever, myalgias) strongly suggest a viral etiology. PLAN 1. Patient Education: Discussed with the patient that her symptoms are consistent with a viral sinusitis, which is typically self-limiting over 7-10 days. Explained that antibiotics are not effective against viruses and are not indicated at this time. Reviewed warning signs that would require follow-up. 2. Supportive Care: Recommend saline nasal irrigation (e.g., Neti pot or sinus rinse bottle) 2-3 times daily to help clear secretions. Increase fluid intake to stay well-hydrated. Use a humidifier at night. Apply warm compresses to the face for comfort. Ensure adequate rest. 3. Medications: Recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen for management of facial pain, headaches, and fever. Advised to discontinue oxymetazoline nasal spray to prevent rebound congestion. If needed for severe congestion, do not use for more than 3 consecutive days. An over-the-counter antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) may be used at night to help with post-nasal drip and cough. 4. Follow-Up: Patient was advised to return to the clinic or seek urgent care if she experiences any of the following: Symptoms persisting for >10 days without improvement. Symptoms that initially improve but then worsen again ("double sickening"). High fever >102°F persisting beyond 3-4 days. Severe, unilateral facial pain or headache. Stiff neck, vision changes, or confusion. No follow-up is required if symptoms resolve as expected.

MEDICAL NOTE DATE OF SERVICE: PATIENT: Adah626 Jenni670 Ward668 DOB/Age: 32-Year-Old SEX: Female RACE: White CHIEF COMPLAINT (CC): Sinus congestion and facial pressure for 5 days. SUBJECTIVE (S): The patient is a 32-year-old female who presents for evaluation of symptoms consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection, now with sinus involvement. She reports that her symptoms began approximately 5 days ago with a sore throat and mild fatigue, which have since progressed. History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports nasal congestion, which is bilateral and persistent. She has been experiencing rhinorrhea, which was initially clear but has now turned a pale yellow color. She describes a constant, dull pressure and aching sensation over her cheeks and forehead, which she notes worsens when she bends forward. Associated with this is a frontal headache, located behind her eyes. She denies any fever, chills, or significant body aches. She reports a mildly productive cough in the mornings, which she attributes to post-nasal drip. She has tried over-the-counter Tylenol with some relief for her headache. She denies any vision changes, tooth pain, or recent dental work. Review of Systems (ROS): CONSTITUTIONAL: Denies fever, chills, recent weight loss. Reports mild fatigue. ENT: Positive for nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, facial pressure, frontal headache, and sore throat. Negative for epistaxis, ear pain, or hearing loss. RESPIRATORY: Reports mild morning cough. Denies shortness of breath, chest pain, or wheezing. All other systems reviewed and are negative. Past Medical History (PMH): No known chronic medical conditions. Medications: None chronic. Takes Tylenol PRN. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies (NKDA). Social History: Denies tobacco, illicit drug use. Drinks alcohol socially. OBJECTIVE (O): Vitals: Temp: 98.6°F (37.0°C) BP: 118/78 mmHg HR: 72 bpm RR: 16/min SpO2: 99% on room air Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented x4, well-developed, in no acute distress. HEENT: Head: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: PERRLA, extraocular movements intact. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae without injection. Ears: TMs gray, cone of light present, no bulging or erythema. Nose: Nasal mucosa is erythematous and edematous. Clear to pale yellow mucus noted in bilateral nasal passages. No purulence. Mild tenderness to palpation over bilateral maxillary and frontal sinuses. Throat: Mildly erythematous posterior oropharynx, no exudates. Tonsils 1+, non-erythematous.

Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. ASSESSMENT (A): 1. Acute Viral Sinusitis: Patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms, including < 10 days of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, facial pressure, and headache. Absence of fever and purulent discharge on exam, along with a normal physical exam aside from nasal mucosal inflammation, points to a viral etiology. PLAN (P): 1. Patient Education: Discussed the diagnosis of acute viral sinusitis. Emphasized that this is caused by a virus and therefore antibiotics are not indicated and will not be effective. Reviewed the typical course of 7-10 days for symptoms to improve. Provided instruction on "red flag" symptoms that would require urgent re-evaluation, including: Fever > 102°F or persistent fever. Symptoms that worsen after initially improving (double sickening). Severe, unilateral headache or visual changes. Neck stiffness or confusion. 2. Treatment Plan (Supportive Care): Saline Nasal Spray/Rinse: Use 2-3 times per day to help thin mucus and moisturize nasal passages. Humidifier: Use at home to add moisture to the air. Warm Compresses: Apply over the sinus areas for comfort. Hydration: Increase fluid intake with water. Pain/Headache Control: Continue to use Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Ibuprofen as needed for headache and facial pain. 3. Follow-Up: Patient to follow up with the clinic in 7-10 days if symptoms are not improving, or sooner if any of the above "red flag" symptoms develop. Return to the emergency department for any severe or acute neurological symptoms.

History of Present Illness (HPI): Ms. Ward is a 35-year-old female who presents for evaluation of sinus symptoms. She reports that 5 days ago, she developed symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory infection, including a sore throat and runny nose. Over the past 3 days, her symptoms have progressed to include significant bilateral nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, and facial pain. She describes the pain as a constant pressure and aching over her cheeks and forehead. She rates the pain as a 6/10 in severity. The pain is worsened by bending forward. She also reports a frontal headache, decreased sense of smell, and thick post-nasal drip that causes a occasional cough, especially at night. She has been managing her symptoms with over-the-counter ibuprofen and a decongestant, which provide temporary relief. She denies any vision changes, severe headache, or confusion. She reports feeling fatigued but denies shortness of breath or chest pain. She had a low-grade fever yesterday, self-measured at 100.2°F. Review of Systems (ROS): HEENT: Positive for nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain, frontal headache, decreased sense of smell, and post-nasal drip. Negative for visual changes, hearing loss, or sore throat at this time. Constitutional: Positive for fatigue and subjective fevers. Negative for chills or unintentional weight loss. Respiratory: Negative for shortness of breath, chest pain, or wheezing. All other systems reviewed and are negative. Past Medical History (PMH): No known chronic medical conditions. Past Surgical History (PSH): None. Medications: Ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Pseudoephedrine as needed for congestion. Allergies: No Known Drug Allergies (NKDA).

OBJECTIVE Vitals: Temperature: 37.8°C (100.0°F) Blood Pressure: 118/75 mmHg Heart Rate: 84 bpm Respiratory Rate: 16/min SpO2: 99% on room air Physical Exam: General: Alert and oriented x4. Well-appearing, in no acute distress. HEENT: Head: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. No scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. Ears: Tympanic membranes normal with good cone of light, no bulging or erythema. Nose: Nasal mucosa is erythematous and edematous. Thick, yellowish discharge noted in nasal passages. Nasal turbinates are swollen. Throat: Mild pharyngeal erythema without exudates. No tonsillar swelling. Neck: Supple, full range of motion. No lymphadenopathy or meningeal signs. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, good air entry, no wheezes or rales. ASSESSMENT & PLAN Assessment: 1. Acute Viral Sinusitis: The patient presents with a <10-day history of classic sinus symptoms (congestion, purulent discharge, facial pain) following a typical upper respiratory infection. Her low-grade fever and lack of severe or worsening symptoms point toward a viral etiology.
2. Fever: Secondary to viral process. Plan: 1. Patient Education: We discussed the diagnosis of acute viral sinusitis. I explained that this is most likely caused by a virus and therefore antibiotics are not indicated and will not be effective. The goal of treatment is supportive care to manage symptoms while her body fights the infection. 2. Supportive Care Measures: Saline Nasal Irrigation: Recommend using a saline spray or neti pot 2-3 times daily to help clear mucus and moisturize nasal passages. Analgesia/Antipyretics: Continue using Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen as needed for facial pain, headache, and fever. Decongestants: Continue pseudoephedrine as needed. An oxymetazoline (Afrin) nasal spray can be used for up to 3 days maximum to relieve severe congestion, with warnings about rebound congestion with longer use. Hydration & Rest: Encourage increased fluid intake and adequate rest. 3. Follow-up: The patient was advised to return to the clinic or seek urgent care if she experiences any of the following "red flag" symptoms: symptoms persisting for >10 days without improvement, symptoms that worsen after initial improvement (double-sickening), high fever >102°F, severe unilateral facial pain, periorbital swelling, or any changes in vision. No follow-up is required at this time, but she is welcome to call or return if her symptoms do not resolve as expected. , MD/DO/PA-C/NP

MEDICAL NOTE PATIENT: Adah626 Jenni670 Ward668 DATE OF BIRTH: DATE OF ENCOUNTER: REASON FOR VISIT: Follow-up for loss of teeth and recent denture fitting. SUBJECTIVE Chief Complaint: "I'm here for a check-up after getting my new dentures." History of Present Illness: The patient is a 35-year-old white female presenting for a follow-up appointment after a recent denture fitting procedure for her partial edentulism. She reports a long-standing history of tooth loss, which she states has caused several issues prior to her prosthetic replacement. Symptoms she experienced from her tooth loss included significant difficulty with chewing, forcing her to avoid hard foods like apples and nuts. She also reported that her speech was affected, specifically with a "whistling" sound when saying certain words, and she felt self-conscious about the appearance of her smile. Since receiving the dentures, the patient reports a substantial improvement in her ability to chew softer foods. She acknowledges that they still feel "a little strange" in her mouth and that she has noticed an increase in salivation, but she was counseled this is expected during the initial adaptation period. She denies any specific areas of pain, sore spots, or ulceration on her gums from the appliance. She has been practicing inserting and removing the dentures at home and feels she is becoming more comfortable with the process. Review of Systems: HEENT: Denies headaches, jaw pain (TMJ), or persistent oral sores. GI: Denies dysphagia. Reports improved dietary intake. All other systems reviewed and are negative. OBJECTIVE Vitals: Temp: 98.6°F (37.0°C) BP: 118/76 mmHg HR: 72 bpm RR: 16 breaths/min O2 Sat: 99% on room air Physical Examination: Oral Cavity: The patient is alert, cooperative, and in no acute distress. On intraoral examination, the new partial dentures are inspected. They are seated properly and demonstrate good stability and retention. The occlusion (bite) appears appropriate with even contacts. The surrounding oral mucosa and alveolar ridges are visualized. There are no visible signs of erythema, pressure sores, or ulcerations. The patient demonstrates proper insertion and removal of the prosthesis without difficulty. ASSESSMENT 1. Partial Edentulism: Status post successful denture fitting.
2. Adapting to New Oral Prosthesis: Patient is experiencing normal initial adaptation symptoms, including mild foreign body sensation and increased salivation.
3. Improved Masticatory Function: Patient's primary symptoms related to tooth loss (difficulty chewing, speech issues) are being successfully addressed by the prosthesis. PLAN 1. Patient Education: Reiterated that minor irritation, increased salivation, and a foreign body sensation are common and should subside within 1-2 weeks. Instructed the patient on proper denture hygiene, including daily brushing and overnight soaking. Advised to start with a soft diet and gradually introduce tougher foods as comfort allows.
2. Follow-Up: The patient is to return to the clinic in 1 week for a routine post-insertion check to evaluate fit, function, and to make any necessary adjustments.
3. Contingency: Instructed the patient to call the office sooner if she develops any painful sore spots or if the denture becomes loose. Scribed by:

MEDICAL RECORD PATIENT: Adah626 Jenni670 Ward668 DATE OF BIRTH: DATE OF ENCOUNTER: TYPE OF ENCOUNTER: Office Visit / Dental Consultation SUBJECTIVE: Chief Complaint (CC): Follow-up for gingivitis. History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 35-year-old white female presenting for evaluation and management of gingivitis. She reports a several-week history of gums that bleed easily when brushing and flossing. She describes her gums as appearing red and puffy, and she has noticed persistent bad breath (halitosis) despite brushing. The patient denies any significant tooth pain or loose teeth. She is here for a scheduled check-up and cleaning. Past Medical History: Non-contributory. Medications: None reported. Allergies: No known drug allergies (NKDA). OBJECTIVE: Vitals: Blood Pressure 120/75 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, Respiratory Rate 16/min, Temperature 98.6°F. Vitals are stable. Physical Examination: Oral Cavity: An intraoral examination was performed. The gingival tissue is generally erythematous (red) and edematous (swollen), with a loss of the typical stippled appearance. Bleeding on probing is noted throughout the mouth, particularly in the interproximal areas. Supragingival and subgingival plaque and calculus are present on multiple teeth. No evidence of periodontal pocketing greater than 3mm or significant gingival recession noted at this time. Procedures/Services Performed: 1. Dental consultation and report.
2. Dental care (regime/therapy) and oral health education provided.
3. Full-mouth removal of supragingival plaque and calculus using dental instruments (prophylaxis).
4. Full-mouth removal of subgingival plaque and calculus using dental instruments (scaling and root planing).
5. Dental plain x-ray, bitewing series taken for diagnostic purposes.
6. Detailed examination of gingivae and supporting structures.
7. Professional dental fluoride treatment applied to all teeth. ASSESSMENT: 1. Chronic Gingivitis, generalized (ICD-10: K05.1)
2. Dental Plaque Induced Gingival Disease (ICD-10: K04.61) PLAN: 1. Procedures: The patient underwent a full-mouth debridement, including scaling and root planing, to remove plaque and calculus. A professional fluoride varnish was applied post-treatment. Patient counseled on the importance of these procedures for halting disease progression. 2. Medications: Prescribed: Sodium Fluoride 0.0272 MG/MG Oral Gel. Instructions: Use a pea-sized amount of the gel once daily, preferably at bedtime after your usual brushing and flossing routine. Apply the gel to a clean toothbrush and brush thoroughly onto all tooth surfaces for one minute. Spit out the excess gel. Do not swallow. For the best results, do not eat, drink, or rinse for at least 30 minutes after use. 3. Patient Education: The patient received extensive oral health education, including: Demonstration and reinforcement of proper brushing technique (modified Bass technique) to clean the gumline effectively. Instruction on correct flossing to remove plaque from between the teeth and under the gumline. Counseling on the role of diet in oral health, with advice to limit sugary snacks and beverages. 4. Follow-up: The patient is scheduled to return in 3 months for a re-evaluation of her gingival health. If significant improvement is noted, we will transition to a standard 6-month recall schedule for preventative care. The patient was advised to call the office sooner if any symptoms worsen or if she has questions. Scribe:
