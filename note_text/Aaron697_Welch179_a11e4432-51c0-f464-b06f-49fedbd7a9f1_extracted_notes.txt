Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess symptom improvement and repeat labs if necessary. 3. Dietary counseling: Encourage a diet rich in Vitamin B12 sources (e.g., meat, fish, dairy) if appropriate, unless contraindicated.

Procedures Performed: 1. Colonoscopy – Completed for screening of colorectal cancer. 2. Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) – Performed to screen for occult blood in feces. 3. Rectal Polypectomy – One or more polyps were identified and removed during the colonoscopy. Symptoms Associated with Screening Procedures: While the patient was asymptomatic prior to the screening, potential symptoms that may arise from these procedures include: - Abdominal Discomfort or Cramping – Due to air insufflation during colonoscopy. - Bloating or Flatulence – Temporary side effects post-procedure. - Mild Rectal Bleeding – Possible after polypectomy, though typically minor and self-limiting. - Constipation or Diarrhea – May occur due to sedation or changes in bowel motility. - Sedation-Related Drowsiness or Nausea – If sedation was administered. The patient was instructed to monitor for any signs of excessive bleeding (e.g., bright red blood per rectum, dizziness) or abdominal pain, and to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur. Post-Procedure Instructions: - Resume normal diet and activity as tolerated. - Avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours if sedation was used. - Follow up with primary care physician or gastroenterologist for pathology results. Assessment: - Asymptomatic patient undergoing routine colorectal cancer screening. - Polyps detected and removed; further evaluation of pathology is pending.

History of Present Illness: The patient presents for a dental check-up following a referral for dental care. He reports symptoms that may be associated with poor oral hygiene or periodontal disease, including: - Persistent bad breath (halitosis) - Bleeding gums, particularly during brushing or flossing - Mild tooth sensitivity - Visible plaque and tartar buildup on teeth - Potential early signs of gingivitis or periodontitis (e.g., redness, swelling of gingiva) Dental Consultation and Procedures Performed: 1. Dental Consultation and Report: A thorough evaluation was conducted, including discussion of the patient’s oral hygiene habits and risk factors for dental disease. 2. Dental Care (Regime/Therapy): A personalized oral hygiene regimen was recommended, including proper brushing and flossing techniques. 3. Removal of Supragingival Plaque and Calculus: Performed using dental instruments to remove hardened plaque (tartar) from the tooth surfaces above the gumline. 4. Removal of Subgingival Plaque and Calculus: Performed using dental instruments to clean below the gumline, addressing potential periodontal pockets. 5. Dental Plain X-ray (Bitewing): Taken to assess interdental bone levels and detect any hidden decay or calculus. 6. Examination of Gingivae: Gingival health was evaluated, noting any inflammation, bleeding, or recession. 7. Oral Health Education Procedures: Patient was educated on proper brushing, flossing, and dietary recommendations to prevent future dental issues. Findings: - Moderate supragingival calculus noted on most tooth surfaces. - Mild subgingival calculus present in some areas. - Gingival inflammation and slight bleeding upon probing observed. - Bitewing X-rays show no evidence of cavities but indicate potential early bone loss in localized areas. Plan: - Continue with recommended oral hygiene regimen. - Return for follow-up in 6 months for re-evaluation. - Consider referral to a periodontist if gingival inflammation or bone loss progresses.
